# Customize Maze

## Introduction @unplugged

Put all these lessons together to create your own maze

## Step One

Use the ``||tiles:set current tilemap to map ||`` code to start your robot on the start tile and set up the tilemap.

```python
tiles.load_map(tiles.create_map(tilemap(""" """)))
```

## Step Two @showhint

Change the dimensions to 10 x 7.

## Step Three @showhint

Now click on the "My Tiles" and then click the plus sign.  You may make a custom tile or use one from the gallery.

You should make as many types of tiles as you would like.  You must make a startTile and a goalTile. Make sure you name them exactly: startTile & goalTile.

## Step Four

Make a coinTile which is just like a regular tile but named "coinTile" exactly.  Wherever you place this on your tilemap a coin will appear.

## Step Five @showhint

Click the walls tool to create walls around the edge and any walls you want inside your robot's world.  If you choose to make walls in your world make sure they are different from the non-wall tiles.

## Step Six

Use the ``||robot:begin screen ||`` code to start your robot on the start tile and set up the tilemap.  You will now see coins wherever there is a coinTile.

```python
robot.begin_screen()

#code for toolbox:
def do_something():
    pass
for i in range(4):
    pass
if robot.can_move("forward"):
    robot.move_forward()

if robot.can_move("right"):
    robot.turn_right()
else:
    robot.turn_left()

robot.move_forward()
robot.place_coin()
robot.collect_coin()
robot.turn_left()
robot.turn_right()
robot.goal_reached()
robot.detect_coin()
```

## Step Seven
Use loops, functions and if statements to get the robot to the goal tile and collect coins along the way.  See how short you can make your code.
